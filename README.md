# Accurate Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of algorithms for the accurate computation of sums and dot products, making use of the [Fused Multiply-Add (FMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiply%E2%80%93accumulate_operation#Fused_multiply.E2.80.93add) operation and error-free transformations.
